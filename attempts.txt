Classification:
#ATTEMPT 1:
We have tried to use a Vector of various size of the byte troughoutput in a 1/10
of a second. we have 6 clasess and achived accuracy of 21% which isnt very good.
using a deep learning network with softmax + regularization, data is scaled.
#ATTEMPT 2:
WE now filtered out non udp traffic and achived an average improvment of 7%.
#ATTEMPT 3:
still using NN we get accuracy of 40% when we use seconds
